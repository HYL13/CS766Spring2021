# An Overview of Map Synthesis with Cartographic Design Using Aerial Images

### Motivation
Map-related services are essential in our daily life, as we utilize maps for various scenarios/applications, e.g., daily commuting navigation, logistics distribution system, queries and visualization of geographic information, request of high-definition maps for self-driving vehicles, etc. Therefore, generating applicable maps and maintaining their latest versions are important tasks, which, unfortunately, can be a laborious and time-consuming process. Nowadays, most maps are created and updated based on the interpretation of aerial/satellite images and field surveys. On the bright side, with the rapid development of remote sensing technologies, many high spatial resolution (HSR) aerial images with a global coverage can be obtained frequently by sensors on aircraft/satellites. Thus, **generating map tiles automatically and aesthetically based on aerial images** has become an emerging research direction for mapping agencies and institutions.

### Procedures
this project aims to propose a CartoGAN model for generating electronic maps that can be in multiple types and more realistic and aesthetic. In order to accomplish this goal, the steps below are required: 
1.	Collect multiple types of electronic maps, e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Baidu Maps, etc. 
2.	Search for usable HSR remote sensing images corresponded to those electronic maps, and use multiple bands (e.g., infrared) in order to improve the model’s ability in feature recognition. 
3.	Construct a classifier similar with (Li et al., 2020) to help the model learn the differences among multiple types of electronic maps so that the model can determine whether the generated electronic map belongs to the correct type during the training process.
4.	Incorporate the concept of “render matrix” and think about its structure with less memory used. 
5.	Build effective architectures of the generator and the discriminator. 
6.	Consider suitable loss functions for the model, e.g., reconstruction loss (for pixel-wise accuracy), a style loss (to reduce high frequency artifacts), and the GAN loss (a feature-wise learnt similarity metric or content loss). 
7.	Determine the evaluation metrics of the model, e.g., Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (Kernel MMD), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Mode Score, Inception Score, Pixel-Level Translation Accuracy, etc.
8.	Compare the results from our model with the ones from other state-of-the-art GANs.
